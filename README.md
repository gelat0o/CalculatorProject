# CalculatorProject
This Python script generates random mathematical exercises with varying numbers of operands and operations.

## Description

- The script prompts the user to input the number of exercises they want to generate.
- It then generates random mathematical expressions with a random number of operands (ranging from 3 to 5) and random operations (+, -, *, /).
- Each expression is evaluated and written with the result to a file named `result.txt`.
- If division by zero occurs during the evaluation of an expression, the error message is written to the file instead of the solution.## Files

## Files

- `main.py`: Python script to generate random mathematical exercises.
- `result.txt`: Output file containing the generated exercises and their solutions.
