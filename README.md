# CalculatorProject
The program receives an input parameter n, and then randomly generates n-channel addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/) exercises. Each number is between 0 and 100, and the operator is between 3 and 5. These exercises are to be written in a "result.txt" file, along with the student ID.
